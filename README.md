# Git commands cheat-sheet: the most useful git commands

# Navigate to your git project folder

Use `cd` to move between folders. E.g:

```
cd Workspace
cd bdl02_markopacak_git_cheatsheet
```

# 2. Check the status of the project

- `git status`

    With `git status` I cab see if some changes have happened and if sone files are ready to be committed.
    It gives me an overview of the project at that specific moment in time.
- `git log`
- `git diff`
